# Install-and-Configure-ClamAV

Project: Installing ClamAV on Ubuntu Server for PCI-DSS Compliance
In this project, I will demonstrate how to install and configure ClamAV antivirus on 
an Ubuntu server to help meet the PCI-DSS framework requirements. The installation process 
will be documented step-by-step, accompanied by screenshots to provide clear guidance.

Objectives:
Ensure the server is secure by implementing antivirus measures.
Comply with PCI-DSS standards for protecting cardholder data.
